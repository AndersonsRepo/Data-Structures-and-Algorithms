/*
 * ordered_array.hpp
 * Definition of the ordered_array class
 *
 * 
 * In this assignment, youâ€™ll implement a simple data structure which maintains a sorted array. 
 * The elements of the arrayz should always be sorted in ascending order; 
 * when you add new elements figure out where they go in the array, 
 * shift everything after them up, and then drop the new element into place. 
 * When you remove an element, you have to find it, and then shift everything after it down.
